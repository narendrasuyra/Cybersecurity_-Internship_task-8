🔒 1. Encryption
A VPN encrypts (scrambles) your internet traffic so no one can read it without the decryption key.

Common protocols & encryption standards:

OpenVPN: Uses AES-256 encryption (very strong).

WireGuard: Uses modern cryptography (ChaCha20, Curve25519) — faster and secure.

IKEv2/IPSec: Good for mobile connections; uses strong ciphers.

Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS): Changes encryption keys regularly so past sessions stay safe even if a key is compromised.

🕵️‍♂️ 2. IP Address Masking
A VPN hides your real IP address and replaces it with the VPN server’s IP.

Makes tracking your physical location harder.

Helps bypass geo-restrictions.

🛡️ 3. No-Logs Policy
A good VPN promises not to keep logs of:

Your browsing activity,

Connection timestamps,

Original IP address.

Note: Always check the provider’s privacy policy and independent audits!

🚫 4. Kill Switch
If your VPN connection drops unexpectedly, the kill switch cuts off your internet traffic to prevent accidental data leaks.

🧩 5. DNS & IPv6 Leak Protection
Prevents your real DNS requests or IPv6 traffic from bypassing the VPN tunnel.

Stops your ISP from seeing what websites you visit.

⚙️ 6. Split Tunneling
Allows you to route some apps through the VPN while other traffic uses your regular connection — useful for speed and flexibility.
